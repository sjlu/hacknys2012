# Fantastic Ideas
* carrotnet
    * mobile hotspot on phone/router (i like phone better)
    * route all traffic through our proxy, replace all images with carrots (or overlap text on top of all images? ads? memes?)

# Ideas
* MongoDB distributed filesystem (gridfs) (http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/GridFS)
    * this exists w/o directory or perm support
    * will bore hapsters
* vim github/redmine plugin
    * either or, redmine is prolly easier but github is trendier
* vim firefox extention
    * vim editing in textboxes
    * tie into vimperator?
* noise level in reviews
    * mobile app that actaully measures noise, sends to us
    * store shit in mongo
    * trends (popular/loud now, not then)
    * (use YQL to actually get reviews and info and shit)
* scavenger hunt app/game
    * get locations via gps/foursquare/QR codes
    * when user gets to the location, twillio calls/texts them, gives them the 
      hint for the next one
    * keep track of users's times to each waypoint, at the end fastest person wins
    * maybe have points/money, you can buy items that either somehow help you (time bonus? optional waypoints?) or hurt others (time penalty, additional waypoints?)
    * instead of just making the game, we could easily make a framework for this (people just enter GPS coordinates (or whatever), and the associate template for twilio to read at that point)
    * users register beforehand (text in, call, maybe with app on phone)
    * this could also be used for those audio guided tours at zoos and shit
* rdio app
    * suggest songs that is in rdio
    * master computer will select songs automagically
    * other people go to web to suggest songs, vote songs in and out
    * github.com/holman/play
* aircrack for android?
    * can the network interface go into monitor mode
