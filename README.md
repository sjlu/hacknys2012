# Ideas
* MongoDB distributed filesystem (gridfs) (http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/GridFS)
    * this exists w/o directory or perm support
    
* vim github/redmine plugin
    * either or, redmine is prolly easier but github is trendier

* vim firefox extention
    * vim editing in textboxes
    * tie into vimperator?

* noise level in reviews 
    * mobile app that actaully measures noise, sends to us
    * store shit in mongo
    * trends (popular/loud now, not then)
    * (use YQL to actually get reviews and info and shit)
